##Part 1

Because you don't actually need to say the position, just the amount of fuel spent

```{r}
### the number must be between the min & max - so 
fuel<-sapply(min(crabs):max(crabs),function(x){
  ### this is the distance between x&the crabs, sum them all
  x<-sum(abs(crabs-x))
x})
```

```{r}
part1<-min(fuel)
part1
```

##Part 2
Is much the same, but the formula is a little different.
```{r}
### the number must be between the min & max - so 
fuel<-sapply(min(crabs):max(crabs),function(x){
  y<-abs(crabs-x)
  sum((y^2+y)/2)})
part2<-min(fuel)
part2
```
